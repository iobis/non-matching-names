# non-matching-names

This workflow builds the OBIS [list of non matching names](https://github.com/iobis/non-matching-names/blob/master/list.csv) on a weekly schedule.

Two files are generated:

- `list_annotated.csv`: these names have a matching annotation in the VLIZ annotated names list
- `list_open`: these files do not have a matching annotation
